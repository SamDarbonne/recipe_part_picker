# Recipe Part Picker

Recipe Part Picker was inspired by www.pcpartpicker.com and simplifies the process of creating a grocery shopping list. Users can browse through a list of recipes created by professional chefs and add their ingredients to an easy to manage shopping list. Future plans include integration with online grocery delivery services to completely streamline the process of choosing meals, creating a shopping list from those meals, and ordering the ingredients on your shopping list. 

## Tech Stack
Recipe Part Picker was built in Ruby on Rails v5.0 and uses the following technologies:
<ul>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>Sass</li>
	<li>Materialize</li>
	<li>BCrypt</li>
</ul>

#### There was also another planned relationship for users to have a recipe list of their own curation so that they could have a custom list of recipes to add to their cart, but it was scrapped due to time constraints.
